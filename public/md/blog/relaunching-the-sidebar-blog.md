Like many other designers coming up in the 2010's, blogging played a big role in my life. Design blogs like [Smashing Magazine](http://smashingmagazine.com/) or [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) are basically how I learned to do what I do today; and writing my own articles helped me not only meet many awesome people online, but even [find a job](http://v3.sachagreif.com/hipmunk-redesign/).

And yeah, Sidebar has had a blog [on Medium](https://blog.sidebar.io/) but it didn't feel very personal – and kind of opposed to my idea of [promoting personal blogs through the new Sidebar Webring](/webring), if I'm honest about it. 

So I whipped up a quick blog that will live on the Sidebar site itself for now, at least until I get it its own subdomain. It's pretty bare bones, but at least it's unique!

But make no mistake: the idea is not to create yet another bland corporate blog full of boring product updates (although there will be those as well, to be sure). Instead, I want to use this blog as a platform to showcase the Sidebar community: interviews, deep dive into Sidebar stats, guest posts… I have many ideas that will hopefully turn this space into something just as awesome as all the other content featured on Sideabr!

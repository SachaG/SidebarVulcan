const contents = `Apply to join the Sidebar Webring by giving us some information about your site. You will be notified by email if your submission is approved. 

#### Who Can Apply?

Anybody can apply, but sites that meet the following criteria have a higher chance of being accepted:

- You're a **personal & independent blog** with a single writer and voice (as opposed to company or corporate blogs).
- Your site has a nice, well-crafted design and layout. 
- You don't publish more than once a day (to avoid flooding the feed).
- You've had pieces of content featured in Sidebar before.
- You write mainly about design.
- You are willing to show a small webring banner somewhere on your site (coming soon).

If you hear nothing back for a week or so, please consider that your application wasn't accepted this time :( Also note that you can submit multiple sites if you'd like.
